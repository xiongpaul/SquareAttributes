This project was created for my software quality assurance class during my time attending college.

It's a barebones console application I built with C# as per the assignment specification. Upon execution, the application asks user to input a value to be used as a 'side' of a square object and stored in memory. Upon reading a valid input, the application will then display a basic menu that will allow the user to:

1) display the current value stored in memory
2) change the value
3) display the perimeter value of the square, based on the value stored in memory
4) display the area of the square, based on the value stored in memory
